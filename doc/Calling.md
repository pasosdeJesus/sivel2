# Public invitation to audit SIVeL 2.0

Thanks to God we can offer USD$100 for the first vulnerability
found and fixed in the most recente version of SIVeL 2.0.

If you belong to an organization that documents 
infractions to International Humanitarian Law or
violations to Human Rights with SIVeL 2, we invite you
to offer an increase in the retribution, in order to 
make more interesting this public invitation for
security auditors.

If you are developer or a security auditor we invite you
to look for vulnerabilities in SIVeL 2.0, either by
experimenting with the test installation for this calling
or by doing your own installation by following the
recommendations for the running environment
(see [README.md](https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/sivel2/blob/sivel2.0/README.md) )
or by auditing the source code that is open source and written
in Ruby with the framework Ruby on Rails.

To report please have into account:
* You found the vulnerability
* The vulnerability needs to be replicable in the test installation.
  Use for example the form that doesn't require authentication:
  <https://defensor.info/sivel2/casos> ;
  and other components with the role "Analista" of the user
  `operador` with password `operador`: 
  <https://defensor.info/sivel2> ;
  or other components as administrator `sivel2` with password `sivel2`.
  That test site runs on the recommended plataform
  (distribution [adJ](https://aprendiendo.pasosdeJesus.org) 7.0
  of OpenBSD, nginx webserver with SSL,
  PostgreSQL with authentication and Ruby on Rails 6.1)
  and with some data from 
  [Banco De Datos de Violencia Pol√≠tica, DH y DIH del CINEP](http://www.nocheyniebla.org).
* Your report must include the methodology you used to find the
  vulnerability and propose a solution for the sources in the 
  branch `sivel2.0` available in the git repository
  https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/sivel2/tree/sivel2.0
  (you can see examples of previous auditories for the version 1.2 at
   <https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/SIVeL/tree/master/doc>)
* Report the vulnerability and propose a solution as stated at:
  <https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/sivel2/blob/sivel2.0/SECURITY.md>
* Your contribution will be evaluated and answered and if we are able
  to reproduce the problem and you followed the steps described here,
  we will pay you the economial retribution as you prefer:
  personally if you live in Colombia, by bank trasnfer in Colombia
  or by sending to your wallete either Bitcoint, or Ethereum or Toncoin.

We thank you for your interest in this public invitation, whose most recent
version is available at
<https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/sivel2/blob/sivel2.0/doc/Calling.md>

We invite you to distribute it without changes.
